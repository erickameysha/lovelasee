                                    The bodice was cute, but uncomfortable and prickly. I postponed the idea of
                                    creatting a brand for six months, and in May 2016 I went to sewing courses. True,
                                    there I did not learn much, but I realized that I would not be responsible for
                                    sewing. But for the creative part - with pleasure.

                                shoot and promote the brand.
                                After a while, I came across an advertisement for a flat for rent in the heart of the
                                old town.
                                It was a former makeshift photo studio, and it looked like the perfect place for
                                creativity: high ceilings, a retro sofa, a white piano. At the same moment, a weakened
                                and blind kitten named Jack showed up next to me.
                                I decided to do two crazy things: I rented a flat that cost half my salary and I took in
                                a sick kitten who needed medical treatment and food (sometimes I had nothing to eat
                                myself). But hardship makes you stronger.

<div>I boarded the Minsk-Moscow bus again with a bag full of panties. In three days I haven't had a single sale. Going back to Minsk with nothing would be very silly, so I took a risky step.

 <div>My friend gave me $1,500 for some expensive clothes in braanded boutiques. I bought them all at once, but I still had $400 left. I decided to buy ads for the money and again wrote to all the bloggers in a row. Yana Yarany wrote back.
The ads worked out great! This investment paid off and I gained invaluable experience and understanding that advertising for money is a great investment in your brand.

<div>had oatmeal on water.
I sold my evening dresses, boots and even my iPhone. Sometimes it was hard mentally. Especially when you or your cats have nothing to eat. I can still remember my signature dish: boiled rice with fried onions and butter, and the cats had oatmeal on water.

Unpaid utility bills and blackout warnings added to the anxiety. I couldn't eat or sleep, I was constantly afraid it would always be like this.
